00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:15,333
Yahoo!

2
00:02:15,416 --> 00:02:17,416
Good one, Billy!

3
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:20,125
Five years have passed

4
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:21,500
since Goku and his friends

5
00:02:21,583 --> 00:02:23,791
thwarted the evil
King Piccolo's plans

6
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:25,791
for global conquest.

7
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:27,458
Thanks to their
heroic efforts,

8
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:30,166
the shadow of doom was
lifted from the world,

9
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,625
and a new day of
hope has dawned.

10
00:02:32,708 --> 00:02:34,958
For in the years since
Piccolo's defeat,

11
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:37,208
it has been a time
of rebuilding, healing,

12
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:40,458
prosperity, and peace
for the citizens of Earth.

13
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:44,416
But, unknown to them,
at this very moment,

14
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,875
a new threat to
humankind is hurtling

15
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:49,166
through the
solar system.

16
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,833
And as the mysterious invader
makes its final approach

17
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:55,958
to Earth, one
thing is certain:

18
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:58,041
The peaceful era the
human race has enjoyed

19
00:02:58,125 --> 00:02:59,875
for the last
five years

20
00:02:59,958 --> 00:03:02,916
is about to come
crashing to an end!

21
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,666
Gohan!

22
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:48,083
Gohan?

23
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,875
It's time to
come in! Gohan!

24
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:08,333
This one ought to do.

25
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:11,458
Yaa!

26
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:21,083
Hey, Gohan!

27
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:24,458
Goku, do you think you've
got enough fire wood there?

28
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:26,875
Yeah.

29
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:29,458
This should last us a
while, don't you think?

30
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:31,208
Ugh. You're
going to hurt yourself

31
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:32,833
doing that one
of these days.

32
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:34,958
Aww, I'm fine.
Where's Gohan?

33
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:37,000
I don't know...

34
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:39,083
But I think you'd better
go find him, don't you?

35
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:41,833
You two are supposed be at
Master Roshi's pretty soon.

36
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:43,958
Oh, yeah!
That's right!

37
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:45,458
You better
take the flying nimbus.

38
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:46,976
You don't want to be
late for your reunion!

39
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,833
Okay! Bye ChiChi!

40
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:52,208
Goku! Be careful!

41
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:55,625
Ugh. I'm going to worry
myself to death...

42
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:10,125
Phew-oo-ee! This job's
bigger than I thought!

43
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:24,833
What is that?

44
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:45,541
My gosh, it hit!

45
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:49,250
I guess I better
go check it out.

46
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,833
Goodness, why me?

47
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:10,458
I better bring
my pea-shooter.

48
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:23,916
I don't like this...

49
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,708
That's no meteor.
It's made of steel!

50
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:30,791
Wh-What in the world?
I'll be darned.

51
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:17,333
So, the creatures on this
planet are still alive.

52
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:19,250
Kakarot has
failed us!

53
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:22,333
You're on my
p-property.

54
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:26,708
Is that so? Hmm...

55
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:28,666
Your power
level is puny.

56
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,416
Heh. Level 5.

57
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:34,958
Don't you come any closer!
Look! I'll use this thing!

58
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:55,000
Heh. What a fragile
breed of people...

59
00:07:57,666 --> 00:08:00,833
I'm picking up a high
power-level from over there.

60
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:03,666
It must be him.

61
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:06,583
Prepare yourself,
Kakarot!

62
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:30,583
I want my Daddy.
I want to go home.

63
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:32,916
Daddy!

64
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,416
Daddy!

65
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,416
Uh, anyone?

66
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:13,541
Uh, hey, Mr. Butterfly!

67
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:18,000
Wait! Come back!

68
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:22,416
I'm not gonna hurt you!
I just wanna look!

69
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:32,083
Aww, c'mon! You want me
to climb up there? Okay.

70
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,125
Aahh!

71
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:44,666
Aww... Hold on.
I'm coming!

72
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:51,708
Say, are you sure there's not
an elevator on this thing?

73
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:21,166
Uh... Hello?

74
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:26,416
M-Mister Butterfly?

75
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:51,833
Uh, n-nice kitty...

76
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:02,041
I know... Play dead!

77
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:28,083
Aah! My hat is gone!

78
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:33,041
No! My Daddy
gave me that hat!

79
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:42,541
My hat!

80
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:55,291
Give me back my hat!

81
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:57,333
You can't have it!

82
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:13,958
Aaahhh...

83
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:02,208
Whoa...

84
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:14,041
Hey! Gohan!

85
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:18,833
Okay.

86
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,416
Aaahh...

87
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,875
Mommy! Daddy!

88
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:47,208
Oh! Well, hello there!
You're a pretty bird.

89
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:00,333
It's nice to meet you.

90
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:07,416
So, do you have a name?
I'm Gohan.

91
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,500
Aahh. Hey, wait!

92
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:21,291
Aahh! Mommy!
Daddy! Help me!

93
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:34,166
Hm? Hey you...
That hat!

94
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:42,958
That's Gohan's! It belongs to
my son. Have you seen him?

95
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:46,916
Where did you
get his hat?

96
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:51,291
I said, where
did you get it?

97
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:20,750
Aah! Help me!

98
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,708
Gohan!

99
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:32,833
Mommy! Daddy!

100
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:35,041
Gohan!

101
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:39,750
Aaaahhh!

102
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:43,250
Gohan!
Can you hear me?

103
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:46,625
Gohan?

104
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:56,166
Gohan!

105
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,791
It's Daddy!

106
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:07,291
Hang on, son!
I'll be right there!

107
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:17,666
Just a little farther!

108
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:25,333
Aaahhh! Daddy!

109
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:27,375
Hang on, Gohan!

110
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:30,791
Help!

111
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:41,000
Daddy!

112
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:44,708
Hurry! It's dark... Uh?

113
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:55,416
Daddy! Help!

114
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:00,375
Gohan!

115
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:08,958
Gohan!

116
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:40,041
Help! I'm stuck! I can't
get down! Wahh! Wahh!

117
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:49,708
Daddy! Thank you, Daddy!
Oh, I was so scared!

118
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:52,958
But, how did you
get all the way up here?

119
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,125
Wow, that's strange.

120
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:06,375
Daddy, uh...

121
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:09,000
I lost my hat.

122
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:13,791
What? Silly... No you didn't.
It's on your head!

123
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:15,333
Now let's go get
you cleaned up.

124
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:16,708
Then you can come
with me to meet

125
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:19,416
all my friends at
Master Roshi's!

126
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,291
That's my boy!

127
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:44,791
Bah! Miserable
little vermin.

128
00:18:58,166 --> 00:19:02,625
What is that? I've never
felt such so much power.

129
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:11,333
It can't be Goku...
It's too horrible.

130
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,208
Who is that?

131
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:24,750
Excuse me
for dropping in.

132
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:27,166
I'm trying to find
a man named Kakarot.

133
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:30,125
I thought you were him.

134
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:31,625
Well, you thought wrong.

135
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:33,908
Now turn around and get out
of here, before I get angry!

136
00:19:33,958 --> 00:19:36,041
Someone's having
a bad day.

137
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:39,791
Believe me, you have
no idea. Now get lost.

138
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:45,291
Oh, you'd like that,
wouldn't you?

139
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:48,291
Power level 322.

140
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:51,333
I can tell you're
not from this planet...

141
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:53,333
But you'd be a
fool to attack me

142
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:56,875
with such an...
insufficient power.

143
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:59,291
Now listen to me!
You came here!

144
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:02,083
I have no intention
of starting a fight!

145
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:03,708
I do.

146
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:10,625
All right!

147
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:13,375
If that's the way
he wants it...

148
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:28,333
Impressive!

149
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:31,625
You actually managed to
singe some of my leg hair.

150
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:36,583
But allow me to demonstrate
a more effective attack.

151
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:42,666
It's one of my favorites.
I call it a Double Sunday.

152
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:46,416
Now... See if you
can follow this one!

153
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:51,625
Well, I guess it's your
lucky day, green man.

154
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:02,416
There it is. Just on the edge
of my scouter's range.

155
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,791
And it's big...

156
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:07,208
It must be the largest
power level on this planet!

157
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:10,291
It's Kakarot...
This time I'm sure!

158
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:23,000
I don't believe it...

159
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:28,750
I hit him full force,
and he didn't even flinch!

160
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:31,416
This guy could
be a problem.

161
00:21:47,416 --> 00:21:49,250
Have you forgotten
your pride, Kakarot?

162
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:53,208
We are Saiyans... The mightiest
warriors in the universe!

163
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:55,833
I can still remember
the day that we first

164
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:58,875
sent you to this
planet as an infant...

165
00:21:58,958 --> 00:22:01,500
We had high hopes for
you then, Kakarot.

166
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:05,375
Why have you not carried
out your mission?

167
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:07,416
Kakarot!

168
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:11,000
Who is this
mysterious Saiyan warrior

169
00:22:11,083 --> 00:22:13,958
that now darkens the
skies with his presence?

170
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:16,041
His search for the
one named Kakarot

171
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:17,875
has already led
him to Piccolo...

172
00:22:17,958 --> 00:22:20,208
One of the most powerful
fighters on Earth.

173
00:22:20,291 --> 00:22:22,666
Could it lead him
to Goku as well?

174
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:24,875
The answers to these
burning questions

175
00:22:24,958 --> 00:22:26,708
will soon
be revealed...

176
00:22:26,791 --> 00:22:29,708
And Goku will discover
the secrets of his past!

177
00:22:29,791 --> 00:22:33,708
Next time on
Dragon Ball Z!
